# Best Practices Guide

This document outlines best practices for maintaining and extending the Battle Results Flask application.

## Code Organization

### Project Structure
The application follows a modular structure:
- `app.py`: Entry point of the application
- `config/`: Configuration modules
- `controllers/`: Business logic
- `db_models/`: Database models
- `routes/`: Route definitions
- `static/`: Static assets (CSS, JavaScript)
- `templates/`: HTML templates
- `docs/`: Project documentation

### Additional Recommended Folders
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests
- `migrations/`: Database migration scripts (if using Alembic)
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers

## Development Practices

### Version Control
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Create feature branches for new features
- Use pull requests for code review
- Tag releases with version numbers

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use a linter like flake8 or pylint
- Consider using Black for automatic code formatting

### Testing
- Write unit tests for controllers and models
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths
- Run tests before committing changes

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit sensitive information (e.g., secrets, API keys)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Consider using a tool like python-dotenv for local development

### Input Validation
- Always validate user input on the server side
- Sanitize data before storing in the database
- Use parameter binding for database queries to prevent SQL injection

### Authentication & Authorization
- If adding user authentication, use a proven library like Flask-Login
- Store passwords using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt)
- Implement proper authorization checks for all routes

### HTTPS
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper HTTPS redirects
- Set appropriate security headers

## Database Best Practices

### Schema Design
- Use meaningful table and column names
- Define appropriate constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
- Create indexes for frequently queried columns

### Migrations
- Use a migration tool like Alembic to manage schema changes
- Never make manual changes to the database schema in production
- Test migrations thoroughly before applying them

### Performance
- Optimize database queries for performance
- Use eager loading to avoid N+1 query problems
- Consider pagination for large result sets

## API Design

### RESTful Principles
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Return appropriate status codes
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Version your API if making breaking changes

### Documentation
- Keep API documentation up to date
- Document all endpoints, parameters, and responses
- Include examples for common use cases

## Deployment

### CI/CD
- Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
- Consider continuous deployment for automatic updates
- Include database migrations in your deployment process

### Monitoring
- Log application errors and warnings
- Set up monitoring for application health
- Monitor database performance

### Backups
- Regularly back up your database
- Test the restoration process
- Consider point-in-time recovery for production data

## Scaling Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- Design the application to be stateless
- Use a load balancer to distribute traffic
- Consider containerization with Docker for easier scaling

### Caching
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Consider using Redis or Memcached for cache storage
- Use ETags for HTTP caching

### Database Scaling
- Consider read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Implement database sharding for very large datasets
- Monitor database performance and scale proactively
